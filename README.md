# BLE Privacy Model

This repo is used to reproduce the result in Table 6 and 7 of our paper.

Execute *scripts/run_all_reachability.sh* to run the verification automatically using the reachability-based privacy model.
It may take up to 2 hours.

Execute *scripts/run_all_oe.sh* to run the verification automatically using the OE-based privacy model.

These two scripts calls other scripts (the script's name starts with *per-device* or *per-pairing*) to verify the privacy of BLE. You can also execute these scripts separately.

## Dependence
M4 and ProVerif (tested with ProVerif version 2.04).

## File explanation

- The name of the **.sh* script files explains which scenario this script verifies.
For example, the *per-device_central_active_tracker.sh* verifies the scenario where the target device adopts the per-device design, the target device is the central role, and the tracker is an active tracker.
In each script, all three relations (i.e., never, paired, and unpaired) and all five identifiers (i.e., PK, LTK, IRK, CSRK, and ID_ADDR) are covered.

- The *model* folder contains the formal model of BLE privacy.
The script utilize the models in this folder to verify BLE privacy.

- The *results.zip* contains the verification result. You can also generate this by yourself using our scripts.
In the *reachability-results* folder, there are eight sub-folders.
Each of the sub-folder is generated by one of the eight scripts under the *scripts/reachability* folder (the *per-device* and *per-pairing* scripts).
In each of the sub-folder, there are several sub-sub-folders containing the verification result.
For example, the folder *reachability-results/per-device-central-active-tracker/Never-1-P2* contains the verification result of the 1 row, P2 column, of the per-device design in Table 6.
You can open the *index.html* file in the folder to check the result.
If the property can be violated, there is also a *trace\*.pdf* file in the folder showing the trace that can violate this property.


- In the *observational_equivalence-results* folder, there are four sub-folders.
Each of the sub-folder is generated by one of the four scripts under the *scripts/observational_equivalence* folder (the *per-device* scripts).
In each of the sub-folder, there are several sub-sub-folders containing the verification result.
For example, the folder *observational_equivalence-results/per-device-central-active-tracker/Never-1-PK* contains the verification result of the 1 row, Active Tracker/Result column in Table 7.
You can open the *index.html* file in the folder to check the result.
If the property can be violated, there is also a *trace\*.pdf* file in the folder showing the trace that can violate this property.
